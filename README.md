Navigate to one of the following folders for accessing the corresponding material:

* [description](https://github.com/Simulation-Benchmarks/11thSPE-CSP/tree/main/description): the official CSP description.

* [evaluation](https://github.com/Simulation-Benchmarks/11thSPE-CSP/tree/main/evaluation): scripts for checking and evaluating results.

* [geometries](https://github.com/Simulation-Benchmarks/11thSPE-CSP/tree/main/geometries): geometry files and scripts for the three variants of the CSP.

* [input_decks](https://github.com/Simulation-Benchmarks/11thSPE-CSP/tree/main/input_decks): grids and configuration files for specific simulators.

* [templates](https://github.com/Simulation-Benchmarks/11thSPE-CSP/tree/main/templates): the questionnaire sheet.

* [thermodynamics](https://github.com/Simulation-Benchmarks/11thSPE-CSP/tree/main/thermodynamics): scripts for creating tables with pure phase properties and solubilities.

We invite you to contribute by opening issues and submitting pull requests. We welcome especially new grid files and simulator input decks.
