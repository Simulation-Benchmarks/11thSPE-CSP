## Eclipse input deck

This input deck for Eclipse consists of the grid together with porosity and intrinsic permeability.
For obtaining PVT tables which are consistent with the CSP description, we refer to the script
[make_ecl_tables.m](https://github.com/Simulation-Benchmarks/11thSPE-CSP/blob/main/thermodynamics/make_ecl_tables.m).
